### SentiCast

SentiCast is a media streaming platform that incorporates an interactive comment section, a feature not available in major streaming platforms like Netflix and PrimeVideo. The platform features a personalized content recommendation system powered by content-based filtering with cosine similarity. It also performs sentiment analysis on user comments, initially tested with multiple models and ultimately optimized with an LSTM model for higher accuracy. The system enhances user interaction and engagement by providing personalized content suggestions based on user insights.
